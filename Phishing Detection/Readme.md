# Phishing sites detecting project
The dataset used for the analysis was taken from one of the [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/phishing-dataset-for-machine-learning).

### **Data description:**

This dataset contains 48 features extracted from 5000 phishing and 5000 legitimate web pages that were downloaded from January to May 2015 and from May to June 2017. We applied an advanced feature extraction technique using a browser automation framework (e.g., Selenium WebDriver), which is more accurate and reliable than the regular expression-based parsing approach.

The data was analyzed using python.

Main used libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Sklearn
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib


The work included data preparation, search for the most important features, comparative analysis of the effectiveness of different models on this dataset, and conclusions and recommendations


The code is based on the work of [MOHAMAD FADIL](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fadilparves/pishing-detection-using-machine-learning/notebook#Columsn-40-to-50) and
